    """
    This function fits a (potentially skewed) Gaussian line profile to a chunk of spectrum.
    Multiple chunks of spectrum (currently up to 2) can be passed, and then this will fit those
    as a doublet, where the second component of the doublet as some separation from the first component,
    a line depth expressed as a ratio of the first component, and the same sigma-width and skew. 
    Each chunk also has its own polynomial-continuum up to degree 2 (cubic).

    The user should supply lower and upper bounds for uniform priors of all model parameters in the correct order.

    Depending on whether 1 or 2 components are set (by passing 1 or 2 chunks), these parameters are:

    beta,A,x0,sigma,alpha,SR,c0,c1,c2. That's an array of len 9.
    beta,A,x0,sigma,alpha,SR,c0,c1,c2,R,dx1,d0,d1,d2. Len 14.

    beta is uniform scaling of the noise. 
    A is the amplitude of the first component.
    x0 is the center wavelength of the first component.
    sigma is the Gaussian sigma width.
    alpha is the skew. Note that for small alpha (<2), sigma and alpha like to be degenerate, so you might consider switching this off.
    SR is the surface ratio of the obscuring cloud. Only used if absorption == True.
    c0,c1 and c2 are the polynomial parameters (offset, linear, cubic).
    
    In case of two terms, the list goes on:
    R is the ratio between the two components. For R=2, the second line is half the strength of that of the first.
    dx1 is the separation (in units of wavelength) between the first and the second component.
    d0,d1 and d2 are again polynomial parameters for the second chunk.

    If you ever want to fit a triplet, you'd have to add a triplet-function with the additional free parameters. 
    If you want to use more polynomial parameters, you'll need to add those to the existing functions, and carefully
    restructure the reading-in of these parameters in the code below.

    Note that the fitting routine oversamples the line-function by a twice a factor (default is 10, that's 20x samples per original grid-point).

    Set the pass_supers keyword if the x-axis is already an array of super-sampled x-values.
    This can be needed if part of your data is duplicated (i.e. on overlapping order edges).
    In that case, you provide the supersampled arrays manually.



       Parameters
    ----------
    x_supers : array-like
        1D array of the input wavelength range, matching the width of y and yerr, or a list of up to 2 of these.

    x : array-like
        1D array of the input wavelength range, matching the width of y and yerr, or a list of up to 2 of these.
    spec : array-like
        2D array of spectra time-series. 
        Its width matches the length of wl. 

    reject regions : list, tuple, optional
        An iterable of two-element iterables that contains the minimum and maximum wavelengths  
       to be ignored when fitting the continuum. Used to reject line regions.

    deg : int, optional
        The degree of the polynomial fit.

    plot : bool, optional
        Plotting for diagnostic check.

    emission : list, optional
        List of line components that should be fitted as emission lines.

    voigt : list, optional
        List of line components that should be fitted using a pseudo-Voigt profile.


    Returns
    -------
    residuals : array
        The continuum-normalized spectrum.
